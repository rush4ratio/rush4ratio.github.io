He has the practical skills to build a variety of web-based software components and the theoretical knowledge to discern patterns as well as data trends; useful in crafting relevant psychological stimuli. Graduating from United States International University (Kenya) summa cum laude in Information Systems & Technology, he is sharpening his analytical skills with an additional qualification as a Bachelor of Economics & Statistics (Kenyatta University, Kenya).</p><p>Balancing form and function he reckons the title 'graphic designer' as a misnomer and would rather be considered as a variant of a functional designer. Rush streamlines communication systems according to modern aesthetics.</p></div></section></div><footer class="footer"> <p>&copy; 9-Mezz 2015</p></footer></body></html>
